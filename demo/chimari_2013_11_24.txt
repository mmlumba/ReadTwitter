Vegas' reputation of having slutty girls will never cease to exist as long as there are teen girls getting pregnant right after high school.

Oh Vegas, how I would KILL to have your 55 degree sunny weather right now.
A lot of people are younger than me at MU! And there's a guy from Vegas that majors in IT too. Guess I'm not special anymore. -sigh-
