Your actions and choices are what brought you to here and now. If you aren't satisfied with the present, it's time for a change.
Rejection is never failure. Failure is throwing in the towel and calling it quits.
Think logically, not emotionally. Be strong of mind and heart, not weak-willed. Always consider the outcome of your actions.
Being right isn't as important as how you handle being right. That is what demonstrates true character.
The sky is not the limit. The limit is how far you are willing to go before giving up. http://t.co/rSm4nRrFDz
If you truly wish to make a difference, don't worry so much about tomorrow. Instead focus on making today the best it can be.
Even Androids use iPhones. http://t.co/1FElANCvCp
Cell is the form of a phone. Android is the system of a phone. So if you have an Android Cell phone, you were created by Dr Gero. #DBZLogic
For the record, I have no idea where my eyebrows go when I become a Super Saiyan 3.
It shouldn’t take tragic events to bring people together. Cherish those around you. Always.
The purpose of life is to bring purpose to the lives of others.

And watch Dragon Ball Z.
How many Saiyans does it take to screw in a lightbulb?

None. That is what Chi-Chi is for.
The most righteous thing one can do is place their wants to the side and focus on the needs of others.
If you fall, it is up to you to pick yourself up. If you fail, do not dwell on it, but learn from it.
Humans make mistakes. That is what it means to be a human. Not everyone gets it right the first time. But everyone can learn.
I'll go first! http://t.co/9sLGM0c8w3
Never give up hope, never give up trying.
What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger. Unless you're a Saiyan. Then being killed also makes you stronger.
RT if you are a fan of Dragon Ball Z!
Um... You did a good job. RT @Madison420Ivy: my #Goku #DragonBallZ costume!! ;D http://t.co/onrXH3Ga7n
There is a difference between trying to be better than you are and trying to change who you are. Train yourself, never change yourself.
If you’re having power level problems I feel bad for you, son. I got 99 problems but becoming Super Saiyan ain’t one.
A true friend doesn’t grieve at your funeral. A true friend searches for the Dragon Balls.

Feelings do not define who you are. Your actions do that. Having self-control over this is a skill that takes time and patience.
Physical or emotional, every bruise, every cut, every broken heart mends itself over time. All wounds heal eventually.
Peace, Love, and Dragon Ball Z

Don't let failure stop you from being great. We all fail. Sometimes a lot. Find strength in your pain and never stop giving it your best.
A single act of random kindness towards another can dramatically change their view of the day. Make a positive difference in someone’s life.
You’re only alone when you’ve left everyone else behind. The value of friendship is beyond all the riches in the world.
When you can’t change the evils of mankind, remaining a good person yourself is a strong step in the right direction.
